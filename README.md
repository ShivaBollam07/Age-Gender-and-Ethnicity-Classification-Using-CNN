# Age,Gender and Ethnicity Detection Using CNN
 
The age and gender detection dataset is a large-scale collection of over 23,704 face images annotated with age, gender, and ethnicity labels. The dataset spans a wide age range from 0 to 116 years old and includes images with variations in pose, expression, illumination, occlusion, and resolution. This diverse dataset enables the models to learn and generalize from a wide range of facial characteristics. The ethnicity labels encompass various ethnic groups, ensuring the models can capture and classify different ethnicities accurately
